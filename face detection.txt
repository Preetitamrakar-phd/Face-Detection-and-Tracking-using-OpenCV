Haar Cascade Frontal Face Algorithm
they use binary image to compare with the face. It is based on the Haar Wavelet technique to analyze pixels in the image into squares by function.
It uses Adaboost machine learning algotrithm for training. This algorithm is opensource

Extarction of the coordinate of face by using "detectMultiScale()" 
Syntax:
faces=face_cascade.detectMultiScale(srcImg,saclefactor,minNeighbors)

Workflow of face detection
1. loding HaarCascadeFace algo with the help of cv library
2. initialize camera
3.readng frame from the camera
4. convert color image into grayscale image
5. obtaining face cooradinates by passing algo
6. drawing the rectangle on the face coordinates
7. Display the o/p frame.
